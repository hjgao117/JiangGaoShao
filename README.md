This repository contains the R scripts to implement the test proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12322

The proposed test can be implemented using the following R scripts:
1. **main.R** includes the main function to implement the proposed test;
2. **auxiliary.R** includes the auxiliary functions to compute the distance matrix for multiple datatypes.

We also provide four examples:
1. **example-multi** repeats the simulation study of the multivariate time series in Appendix A.2;
2. **example-func** repeats the simulation study of the functional time series in Section 5.1;
3. **example-cov** repeats the simulation study of the covariance matrix time series in Section 5.2;
4. **example-dist** repeats the simulation study of the distributional time series in Section 5.3.
